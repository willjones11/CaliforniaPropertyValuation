# Property Valuation Prediction with Machine Learning and Database Analysis

This project addresses the challenge of rapidly changing property values, leaving homeowners uncertain about their property's worth. By leveraging the power of database systems and machine learning algorithms, we aim to perform comprehensive market analysis and predict property valuations in the real estate domain.

## Key Features:

* **Data-driven Exploration:** Using a rich dataset from the 2017 Zillow Kaggle Competition, we embark on a journey of data exploration and transformation, focusing on critical phases such as data cleaning, analysis, model development, and database implementation.
* **Innovative Methodology:** Our approach stands out by combining advanced techniques, including multiple linear regression and K-Nearest Neighbors models, with novel feature selection strategies to achieve accurate property valuation predictions.
* **Insights from SQL Queries:** We harness the power of Structured Query Language (SQL) to extract meaningful insights and identify trends within the *Zillow dataset. Through customized SQL queries, we unlock valuable information on property details, sales trends, and geographic patterns.
* **Lessons and Future Directions:** While our models achieved promising results, there's room for improvement. We offer insights into missing data issues and propose future research to enhance database completeness and refine our prediction models further.
This project contributes to enhancing our understanding of real estate market dynamics and empowers homeowners with valuable insights for making informed property-related decisions. The code, data preprocessing steps, and model development details are shared in this repository, inviting collaboration and future advancements in property valuation prediction.
